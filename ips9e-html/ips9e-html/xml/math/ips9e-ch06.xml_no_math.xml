<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-008" block_type="CO-TXT-ni">Statistical inference draws conclusions about a population or process from sample data. It also provides a statement of how much confidence we can place in our conclusions. Although there are numerous methods for inference, there are only a few general types of statistical inference. This chapter introduces the two most common types: <em>confidence intervals</em> and <em>tests of significance</em>.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-009" block_type="CO-TXT">Because the underlying reasoning for these two types of inference remains the same across different settings, this chapter considers just one simple setting that is closely related to our study of the sampling distributions of <phrase data-math="math_1"></phrase> in <link href="ips9e-ch05-sec1-02">Section 5.2</link> (page 293): inference about the mean of a large population whose standard deviation is known. This setting, although unrealistic, allows us to focus on the underlying rationale of statistical inference rather than the calculations.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-010" block_type="CO-TXT">Later chapters present inference methods to use in most of the settings we met in learning to explore data. In fact, there are libraries&#8212;both of books and of computer software&#8212;full of more elaborate statistical techniques. Informed use of any of these methods, however, requires a firm understanding of the underlying reasoning. That is the goal of this chapter. A computer or calculator will do the arithmetic, but <em>you must exercise sound judgment based on understanding.</em></p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-012" block_type="CO-TXT-ni">The purpose of statistical inference is to draw conclusions from data. Formal inference emphasizes substantiating our conclusions via probability calculations. Probability allows us to take chance variation into account. Here is an example.</p>

Foresters who study these trees are interested in how the trees are distributed in the forest. Is there some sort of clustering, resulting in regions of the forest with more trees than others? Or are the tree locations random, resulting in no particular patterns? <link href="figure_6_1.html">Figure 6.1</link> gives a plot of the locations of all 584 longleaf pine trees in a 200-meter by 200-meter region in the Wade Tract.<termref term="fn_ch6_fn1"><sup>1</sup></termref></p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-016" block_type="EXP-last">Do the locations appear to be random, or do there appear to be clusters of trees? One approach to the analysis of these data indicates that a pattern as clustered as, or more clustered than, the one in <link href="figure_6_1.html">Figure 6.1</link> would occur only 4&#37; of the time if, in fact, the locations of longleaf pine trees in the Wade Tract are random.

Twenty patients are randomly assigned to receive the oral medication, and another 20 receive the topical medication. Fifteen (75&#37;) of those taking the oral medication find satisfactory symptom relief versus only 11 (55&#37;) of the topical medication patients.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-020" block_type="EXP-last">Our unaided judgment suggests that the oral medication is better, 75&#37; to 55&#37;. However, probability calculations tell us that a difference this large or larger between the results in the two groups of 20 patients would occur about one time in five simply because of chance variation. In this case, it is better to conclude that the data fail to establish a real difference between the two treatments. This probability (nearly 0.19) is too large to ignore.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-021" block_type="TXT">In this chapter, we introduce the two most frequently used types of statistical inference. <link href="ips9e-ch06-sec1-01">Section 6.1</link> concerns <em>confidence intervals</em> for estimating the value of a population parameter. <link href="ips9e-ch06-sec1-02">Section 6.2</link> presents <em>tests of significance,</em> which assess the evidence for a claim, such as those in <link href="example_6_1.html">Examples 6.1</link> and <link href="example_6_2.html">6.2</link>.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-023" block_type="TXT">Both types of inference are based on the sampling distributions of statistics. That is, both report probabilities that state <em>what would happen if we used the inference method many times.</em> This kind of probability statement is characteristic of standard statistical inference. Users of statistics must understand the nature of this reasoning and the meaning of the probability statements that appear, for example, online and in journal articles and statistical software output.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-024" block_type="TXT">Because the methods of formal inference are based on sampling distributions, they require a probability model for the data. Trustworthy probability models can arise in many ways, but the model is most secure and inference is most reliable when the data are produced by a properly randomized design.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-026" block_type="TXT"><em>When you use statistical inference, you are acting as if the data come from a random sample or a randomized experiment.</em> If this is not true, your conclusions may be open to challenge. Do not be overly impressed by the complex details of formal inference. This elaborate machinery cannot remedy basic flaws in producing the data such as voluntary response samples and confounded experiments. Use the common sense developed in your study of the first three chapters of this book, and proceed to detailed formal inference only when you are satisfied that the data deserve such analysis.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-033" block_type="TXT-ni">The SAT is a widely used measure of readiness for college study. It consists of three sections, one for mathematical reasoning ability (SATM), one for verbal reasoning ability (SATV), and one for writing ability (SATW). Possible scores on each section range from 200 to 800, for a total range of 600 to 2400. Since 1995, section scores have been <em>recentered</em> so that the mean is approximately 500 with a standard deviation of 100 in a large &#8220;standardized group.&#8221; This scale has been maintained so that scores have a constant interpretation.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-040" block_type="TXT">But how reliable is this estimate? A second sample of 500 students would surely not give a sample mean of 495 again.

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-187" block_type="TXT">Finally, you should understand what statistical confidence does not say. Based on our SRS in <link href="example_6_3.html">Example 6.3</link>, we are 95&#37; confident that the mean SATM score for the California students lies between 486 and 504. This says that this interval was calculated by a method that gives correct results in 95&#37; of all possible samples. It does <em>not</em> say that the probability is 0.95 that the true mean falls between 486 and 504. <em>No randomness remains after we draw a particular sample and compute the interval.</em> The true mean either is or is not between 486 and 504.

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-286" block_type="TXT-ni">The confidence interval is appropriate when our goal is to estimate population parameters.

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-288" block_type="TXT-ni">A significance test is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a hypothesis whose truth we want to assess. The hypothesis is a statement about the population parameters. The results of a test are expressed in terms of a probability that measures how well the data and the hypothesis agree. We use the following examples to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<box id="ips9e-ch06-box-029" numbered="false" block_type="EXP" data-filename="example_6_8.html">
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-289" block_type="EXP-N">EXAMPLE 6.8</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-290" block_type="EXP-TXT-first"><phrase block_type="EXP-T-ri">Scholarship amount by borrower status.</phrase> One purpose of Sallie Mae&#8217;s annual study described in <link href="example_6_4.html">Example 6.4</link> (page 350) is to allow comparisons of different subgroups. For example, in the latest report, 980 of the 1593 participants (61.5&#37;) did not borrow any money to pay for college. The average scholarship amount among these participants was &#36;3925. The average scholarship among those who did borrow was &#36;4350. The difference of &#36;425 is fairly large, but we know that these numbers are estimates of the population means. If we took different samples, we would get different estimates.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-291" block_type="EXP-last">Can we conclude from these data that the average scholarship amounts in these two groups are different? One way to answer this question is to compute the probability of obtaining a difference as large or larger than the observed &#36;425 assuming that, in fact, there is no difference in the population means. This probability is 0.23. Because this probability is not particularly small, we conclude that observing a difference of &#36;425 is not very surprising when the population means are equal. The data do not provide enough evidence for us to conclude that the average scholarship amount for borrowers and non-borrowers differ.</p>

The parents&#8217; contribution averages &#36;4444 among undergraduates at public colleges, while it is &#36;6083 among undergraduates at private schools. Do parents pay more of their current income for undergraduates going to private schools? The observed difference is &#36;1639, but as we learned in the previous example, an observed difference in means is not necessarily sufficient for us to conclude that the population means are different.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-295" block_type="EXP-last">Again, we answer this question with a probability calculated under the assumption that there is <em>no difference in the population means</em>. The probability is 0.0003 of observing a difference in mean contributions that is &#36;1639 or more when there really is no difference. Because this probability is so small, we have sufficient evidence in the data to conclude that the average current income contribution of parents is higher for undergraduates going to a private school than undergraduates going to a public school.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-425" block_type="TXT">Suppose that we have calculated a test statistic <em>z</em> = 1.7.

The <em>P</em>-value is the probability that a standard Normal <em>Z</em> is at least as far from zero as the observed <em>z</em>.

One way to formulate hypotheses about whether or not the trees are randomly distributed in the tract is to examine the average location in the north&#8211;south direction. The values range from 0 to 200, so if the trees are uniformly distributed in this direction, any difference from the middle value (100) should be due to chance variation. The sample mean for the 584 trees in the tract is 99.74. A theoretical calculation based on the assumption that the trees are uniformly distributed gives a standard deviation of 58. Carefully state the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of this variable. Note that this requires that you translate the research question about the random distribution of the trees into specific statements about the mean of a probability distribution. Test your hypotheses, report your results, and write a short summary of what you have found.</p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-630" block_type="TXT-ni">Carrying out a test of significance is often quite simple, especially if the <em>P</em>-value is given effortlessly by a computer. Using tests wisely is not so simple. Each test is valid only in certain circumstances, with properly produced data being particularly important.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-631" block_type="TXT">The <em>z</em> test, for example, should bear the same warning label that was attached in <link href="ips9e-ch06-sec1-01">Section 6.1</link> to the corresponding confidence interval (<link href="alias:page_355">page 355</link>). Similar warnings accompany the other tests that we will learn. There are additional caveats that concern tests more than confidence intervals, enough to warrant this separate section. Some hesitation about the unthinking use of significance tests is a sign of statistical maturity.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-632" block_type="TXT">The reasoning of significance tests has appealed to researchers in many fields, so that tests are widely used to report research results. In this setting <em>H<sub>a</sub></em> is a &#8220;research hypothesis&#8221; asserting that some effect or difference is present. The null hypothesis <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> says that there is no effect or no difference. A low <em>P</em>-value represents good evidence that the research hypothesis is true. Here are some comments on the use of significance tests, with emphasis on their use in reporting scientific research.</p>

Using a significance test with low power makes it unlikely that you will find a significant effect even if the truth is far from the null hypothesis. A null hypothesis that is, in fact, false can become widely believed if repeated attempts to find evidence against it fail because of low power. The following example illustrates this point.</p>

No information available now will help us predict stock prices in the future because the efficient working of the market has already incorporated all available information in the present price. Many studies have tested the claim that one or another kind of information is helpful. In these studies, the efficient market hypothesis is <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>, and the claim that prediction is possible is <em>H<sub>a</sub></em>. Almost all the studies have failed to find good evidence against <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>. As a result, the efficient market hypothesis is quite popular. But an examination of the significance tests employed finds that the power is generally low. Failure to reject <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> when using tests of low power is not evidence that <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> is true. As one expert says, &#8220;The widespread impression that there is strong evidence for market efficiency may be due just to a lack of appreciation of the low power of many statistical tests.&#8221;<termref term="fn_ch6_fn30"><sup>30</sup></termref></p>

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-827" block_type="TXT">The two types of error and their probabilities give another interpretation of the significance level and power of a test. The distinction between tests of significance and tests as rules for deciding between two hypotheses does not lie in the calculations <em>but in the reasoning that motivates the calculations.</em> In a test of significance, we focus on a single hypothesis (<em>H</em><sub>0</sub>) and a single probability (the <em>P</em>-value). The goal is to measure the strength of the sample evidence against <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>. Calculations of power are done to check the sensitivity of the test. If we cannot reject <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>, we conclude only that there is not sufficient evidence against <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>, not that <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> is actually true.</p>
<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-828" block_type="TXT">If the same inference problem is thought of as a decision problem, we focus on two hypotheses and give a rule for deciding between them based on the sample evidence. Therefore, we must focus equally on two probabilities, the probabilities of the two types of error. We must choose one hypothesis and cannot abstain on grounds of insufficient evidence.</p>

We continued to call one of the hypotheses in a decision problem <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>.

<p id="ips9e-ch06-p-835" block_type="TXT">Testing hypotheses may seem to be a hybrid approach. It was, historically, the effective beginning of decision-oriented ideas in statistics. An impressive mathematical theory of hypothesis testing was developed between 1928 and 1938 by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson. The decision-making approach came later (1940s). Because decision theory in its pure form leaves you with two error probabilities and no simple rule on how to balance them, it has been used less often than either tests of significance or tests of hypotheses. Decision ideas have been applied in testing problems mainly by way of the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing theory. That theory asks you first to choose <em>&#x3b1;</em>, and the influence of Fisher has often led users of hypothesis testing comfortably back to <em>&#x3b1;</em> = 0.05 or <em>&#x3b1;</em> = 0.01. Fisher, who was exceedingly argumentative, violently attacked the Neyman-Pearson decision-oriented ideas, and the argument still continues.</p>
