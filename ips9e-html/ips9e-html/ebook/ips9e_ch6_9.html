<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch06-p-630"><p>Carrying out a test of significance is often quite simple, especially if the <em>P</em>-value is given effortlessly by a computer. Using tests wisely is not so simple. Each test is valid only in certain circumstances, with properly produced data being particularly important.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch06-p-631"><p>The <em>z</em> test, for example, should bear the same warning label that was attached in <span data-type="link" data-href="ips9e_ch6_3.html">Section 6.1</span> to the corresponding confidence interval (<span data-type="link" data-href="alias:page_355">page 355</span>). Similar warnings accompany the other tests that we will learn. There are additional caveats that concern tests more than confidence intervals, enough to warrant this separate section. Some hesitation about the unthinking use of significance tests is a sign of statistical maturity.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch06-p-632"><p>The reasoning of significance tests has appealed to researchers in many fields, so that tests are widely used to report research results. In this setting <em>H<sub>a</sub></em> is a “research hypothesis” asserting that some effect or difference is present. The null hypothesis <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> says that there is no effect or no difference. A low <em>P</em>-value represents good evidence that the research hypothesis is true. Here are some comments on the use of significance tests, with emphasis on their use in reporting scientific research.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch06-p-635"><p>The intention of a test of significance is to give a clear statement of the degree of evidence provided by the sample against the null hypothesis. The <em>P</em>-value does this. It is common practice to report <em>P</em>-values and to describe results as statistically significant whenever <em>P</em> ≤ 0.05. <em>However, there is no sharp border between “significant” and “not significant,” only increasingly strong evidence as the P-value decreases.</em> Having the <em>P</em>-value with a description of the effect that we have found allows us to draw better conclusions from our data.</p></div>

This means that there are 3 chances in 1,000,000 of observing a sample mean this far or farther away from the null hypothesized value of <em>μ</em>. This kind of event is virtually impossible if the null hypothesis is true. There is no ambiguity in the result; we can clearly reject the null hypothesis.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch06-p-643"><p>We frequently report small <em>P</em>-values such as that in the previous example as <em>P</em> &lt; 0.001. This corresponds to a chance of 1 in 1000 and is sufficiently small to lead us to a clear rejection of the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch06-p-644"><p>One reason for the common use of <em>α</em> = 0.05 is the great influence of Sir R. A. Fisher, the inventor of formal statistical methods for analyzing experimental data.

Suppose that this conclusion was obtained by examining an SRS of police records of break-ins and determining whether the percent of homes with alarm systems was significantly smaller than 50%. Explain why the significance of this study is suspect and propose an alternative study that would help clarify the importance of an alarm system.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch06-p-688"><p>Statistical significance is an outcome much desired by researchers. It means (or ought to mean) that you have found an effect that you were looking for. <em>The reasoning behind statistical significance works well if you decide what effect you are seeking, design an experiment or sample to search for it, and use a test of significance to weigh the evidence you get.</em> But because a successful search for a new scientific phenomenon often ends with statistical significance, it is all too tempting to make significance itself the object of the search. There are several ways to do this, none of them acceptable in polite scientific society.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-first" id="ips9e-ch06-p-690"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-T-ri">Genomics studies.</span> In genomics experiments, it is common to assess the differences in expression for tens of thousands of genes. If each of these genes was ex-amined separately and statistical significance declared for all that had <em>P</em>-values that pass the 0.05 standard, we would have quite a mess. In the absence of any real biological effects, we would expect that, by chance alone, approximately 5% of these tests will show statistical significance. Much research in genomics is directed toward appropriate ways to deal with this situation.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch6_fn28"><sup>28</sup></span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch06-p-692"><p>We do not mean that searching data for suggestive patterns is not proper scientific work. It certainly is. Many important discoveries have been made by accident rather than by design. Exploratory analysis of data is an essential part of statistics. We do mean that the usual reasoning of statistical inference does not apply when the search for a pattern is successful. <em>You cannot legitimately test a hypothesis on the same data that first suggested that hypothesis.</em> The remedy is clear. Once you have a hypothesis, design a study to search specifically for the effect you now think is there. If the result of this study is statistically significant, you have real evidence.</p></div>
