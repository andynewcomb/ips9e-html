These are (1) transparency and control: when companies collect information from consumers for advertising, they should tell consumers how the data will be collected, and consumers should be given a choice about whether to allow the data to be collected; (2) security and data retention: data should be kept secure and should be retained only as long as they are needed; (3) privacy: before data are used in a way that differs from promises made when they were collected, consent should be obtained from the consumer; and (4) sensitive data: affirmative express consent should be obtained before using any sensitive data.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch3_fn32">

For example, satellite weather data produced by the U.S. National Weather Service are available free to TV stations for their weather reports and to anyone on the Internet. <em>Opinion 1:</em> Government data should be available to everyone at minimal cost. <em>Opinion 2:</em> The satellites are expensive, and the TV stations are making a profit from their weather services, so they should share the cost. European governments, for example, charge TV stations for weather data. Which opinion do you support, and why?

        <span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.108 Should we ask for the consent of the parents?</span> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a survey of teenagers, asked the subjects if they were sexually active. Those who said Yes were then asked, “How old were you when you had sexual intercourse for the first time?” Should consent of parents be required to ask minors about sex, drugs, and other such issues, or is consent of the minors themselves enough? Give reasons for your opinion.

        <span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.109 A theft experiment.</span> Students sign up to be subjects in a psychology experiment. When they arrive, they are told that interviews are running late and are taken to a waiting room. The experimenters then stage a theft of a valuable object left in the waiting room. Some subjects are alone with the thief, and others are in pairs—these are the treatments being compared. Will the subject report the theft? The students had agreed to take part in an unspecified study, and the true nature of the experiment is explained to them afterward. Do you think this study is ethically OK?

        <span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.110 A cheating experiment.</span> A psychologist conducts the following experiment. She measures the attitude of subjects toward cheating and then has them play a game rigged so that winning without cheating is impossible. The computer that organizes the game also records—unknown to the subjects—whether or not they cheat. Then attitude toward cheating is retested. Subjects who cheat tend to change their attitudes to find cheating more acceptable. Those who resist the temptation to cheat tend to condemn cheating more strongly on the second test of attitude. These results confirm the psychologist’s theory. This experiment tempts subjects to cheat. The subjects are led to believe that they can cheat secretly when, in fact, they are observed. Is this experiment ethically objectionable? Explain your position.
