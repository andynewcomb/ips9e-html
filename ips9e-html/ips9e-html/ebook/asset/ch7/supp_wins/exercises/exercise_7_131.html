One study examined the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on body composition and the intake of other foods. Fourteen subjects participated in a crossover design where they either drank wine for the first six weeks and then abstained for the next six weeks or vice versa.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch7_fn47"><sup>47</sup></span> During the period when they drank wine, the subjects, on average, lost 0.4 kilogram (kg) of body weight; when they did not drink wine, they lost an average of 1.1 kg. The standard deviation of the difference between the weight lost under these two conditions is 8.6 kg. During the wine period, they consumed an average of 2589 calories; with no wine, the mean consumption was 2575. The standard deviation of the difference was 210.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="CR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch07-p01132"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(c)</span> One concern with studies such as this, with a small number of subjects, is that there may not be sufficient power to detect differences that are potentially important. Address this question by computing 95% confidence intervals for the two measures and discuss the information provided by the intervals.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="CR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch07-p01133"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(d)</span> Here are some other characteristics of the study. The study periods lasted for six weeks. All subjects were males between the ages of 21 and 50 years who weighed between 68 and 91 kg. They were all from the same city. During the wine period, subjects were told to consume two 135-milliliter (ml) servings of red wine per day and no other alcohol. The entire six-week supply was given to each subject at the beginning of the period. During the other period, subjects were instructed to refrain from any use of alcohol. All subjects reported that they complied with these instructions except for three subjects, who said that they drank no more than three to four 12-ounce bottles of beer during the no-alcohol period. Discuss how these factors could influence the interpretation of the results.</p></div></li>
