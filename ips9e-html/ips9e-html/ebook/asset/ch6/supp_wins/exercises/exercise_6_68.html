A total of <em>n</em> = 1454 families with one child between the ages of 8 months and 8 years participated.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch6_fn21"><sup>21</sup></span> For those families in which the caregiver had a high school degree or less, the child was exposed to an average of 313.0 minutes of background television per day. For those families in which the caregiver had some college or a college degree, the child was exposed to an average of 218.8 minutes per day. These average times were reported to be significantly different with <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05. The actual <em>P</em>-value is 0.003. Explain why the actual <em>P</em>-value is more informative than the statement of significance at the 0.05 level.</p></div>
