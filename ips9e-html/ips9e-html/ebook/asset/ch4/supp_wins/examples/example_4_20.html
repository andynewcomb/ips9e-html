Deaths from SIDS have been greatly reduced by placing babies on their backs, but as yet no cause is known.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch04-p-229"><p>When more than one SIDS death occurs in a family, the parents are sometimes accused. One &#8220;expert witness&#8221; popular with prosecutors in England told juries that there is only a 1 in 73 million chance that two children in the same family could have died from SIDS. Here&#8217;s his calculation: the rate of SIDS in a nonsmoking middle-class family is 1 in 8500. So the probability of two deaths is</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch04-p-232"><p>As the Royal Statistical Society said, this reasoning is nonsense. It assumes that SIDS deaths in the same family are independent events. The cause of SIDS is unknown: &#8220;There may well be unknown genetic or environmental factors that predispose families to SIDS, so that a second case within the family becomes much more likely.&#8221;<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch4_fn4"><sup>4</sup></span> The British government decided to review the cases of 258 parents convicted of murdering their babies.</p></div>
