<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch04-p-1061"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">4.131 A fair bet at craps.</span> Almost all bets made at gambling casinos favor the house. In other words, the difference between the amount bet and the mean of the distribution of the payoff is a positive number. An exception is &#8220;taking the odds&#8221; at the game of craps, a bet that a player can make under certain circumstances. The bet becomes available when a shooter throws a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the initial roll. This number is called the &#8220;point&#8221;; when a point is rolled, we say that a point has been established. If a 4 is the point, an odds bet can be made that wins if a 4 is rolled before a 7 is rolled. The probability of winning this bet is 1/3, and the same payoff for a $10 bet is $20 (you keep the $10 you bet and you receive an additional $20). The same probability of winning and payoff apply for an odds bet on a 10. For an initial roll of 5 or 9, the odds bet has a winning probability of 2/5, and the payoff for a $10 bet is $15. Similarly, when the initial roll is 6 or 8, the odds bet has a winning probability of 5/11, and the payoff for a $10 bet is $12.</p></div>
