Here is the idea. To ask a sample of students whether they have plagiarized a term paper while in college, have each student toss a coin in private. If the coin lands heads <em>and</em> they have not plagiarized, they are to answer No. Otherwise, they are to give Yes as their answer. Only the student knows whether the answer reflects the truth or just the coin toss, but the researchers can use a proper random sample with follow-up for nonresponse and other good sampling practices.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch04-p-1079"><p>Suppose that, in fact, the probability is 0.3 that a randomly chosen student has plagiarized a paper. Draw a tree diagram in which the first stage is tossing the coin and the second is the truth about plagiarism. The outcome at the end of each branch is the answer given to the randomized-response question. What is the probability of a No answer in the randomized-response poll? If the probability of plagiarism were 0.2, what would be the probability of a No response on the poll? Now suppose that you get 39% No answers in a randomized-response poll of a large sample of students at your college. What do you estimate to be the percent of the population who have plagiarized a paper?</p></div>
