        <span data-block_type="SR-XH">2.135 Online courses.</span> Many colleges offer online versions of some courses that are also taught in the classroom. It often happens that the students who enroll in the online version do better than the classroom students on the course exams. This does not show that online instruction is more effective than classroom teaching because the people who sign up for online courses are often quite different from the classroom students. Suggest some student characteristics that you think could be confounded with online versus classroom.

This does not mean that a man can raise his income by getting married. Suggest several lurking variables that you think are confounded with marital status and that help explain the association between marital status and income.

The program assesses each participant’s fitness, using a treadmill test, and also administers a personality questionnaire. There is a moderately strong positive correlation between fitness score and score for self-confidence. Is this good evidence that improving fitness increases self-confidence? Explain why or why not.

The union claimed that exposure to chemicals used in production caused the miscarriages. Another possible explanation is that these workers spend most of their work time standing up. Illustrate these relationships in a diagram like one of those in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_2_31.html">Figure 2.31</span>.

Does this mean that you can shorten a hospital stay by choosing a small hospital? Use a diagram like one of those in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_2_31.html">Figure 2.31</span> to explain the association.

In particular, suggest some other variables that may be confounded with heavy TV viewing and may contribute to poor grades.

Those who took the refresher sessions performed worse than those who did not on the final exam in the statistics course. Can you conclude that the refresher course has a negative impact on performance in the statistics course? Explain your answer.
