We might do an observational study that compares students who happened to be in smaller classes with those who happened to be in larger classes in their early school years. Small classes are expensive, so they are more common in schools that serve richer communities. Students in small classes tend to also have other advantages: their schools have more resources, their parents are better educated, and so on. Confounding makes it impossible to isolate the effects of small classes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-127"><p>The Tennessee STAR program was an experiment on the effects of class size. It has been called “one of the most important educational investigations ever carried out.” The <em>subjects</em> were 6385 students who were beginning kindergarten. Each student was assigned to one of three <em>treatments</em>: regular class (22 to 25 students) with one teacher, regular class (22 to 25 students) with a teacher and a full-time teacher’s aide, and small class (13 to 17 students). These treatments are levels of a single <em>factor</em>, the type of class. The students stayed in the same type of class for four years, then all returned to regular classes. In later years, students from the small classes had higher scores on the <em>outcomes</em>, standard tests. The benefits of small classes were greatest for minority students.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch3_fn8"><sup>8</sup></span></p></div>

In an experiment, we study the specific factors we are interested in while controlling the effects of <strong>lurking variables</strong>. All the students in the Tennessee STAR program followed the usual curriculum at their schools. Because students were assigned to different class types within their schools, school resources and family backgrounds were not confounded with class type. The only systematic difference was the type of class. When students from the small classes did better than those in the other two types, we can be confident that class size made the difference.</p></div>

</ul>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-177"><p>That “either-or” deserves more comment. We cannot say that <em>all</em> the difference in the satisfaction with the two smartphones is caused by the characteristics of the phones. There would be some difference even if both groups used the same phone. Some students would be more likely to be highly favorable of any new phone. Chance can assign more of these students to one of the phones so that there is a chance difference between the groups. We would not trust an experiment with just one subject in each group, for example. The results would depend too much on which phone got lucky and received the subject who was more likely to be highly satisfied. If we assign many students to each group, however, the effects of chance will average out. There will be little difference in the satisfaction between the two groups unless the phone characteristics causes a difference. “Use enough subjects to reduce chance variation” is the third big idea of statistical design of experiments.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch03-p-184"><p>The idea of randomization is to assign subjects to treatments by drawing names from a hat. In practice, experimenters use software to carry out randomization. For example, most statistical software can choose five out of a list of 10 at random. The list might contain the names of 10 human subjects to be randomly assigned to two groups. The five chosen form one group, and the five that remain form the second group. The <em>Simple Random Sample</em> applet on the text website makes it particularly easy to choose treatment groups at random.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-186"><p>When we randomize, we first give a <span data-type="termref" data-term="label"><strong>label</strong></span><span data-block_type="MN-GL-term">label</span> to each in the collection of items to be randomized. The label could be the name of a subject in a clinical study or simply a numerical identification number. We then perform the randomization using software or a table of random numbers. To illustrate these methods, let’s randomize 10 subjects for a study that will compare a treatment with a placebo control. We will randomly select the five subjects for the treatment group, and the remaining subjects will receive the placebo. We start by labeling the subjects with the numbers 1 through 10.</p></div>

Here are some brief examples of what can go wrong.</p></div>

To try to answer this question, psychologists asked student subjects to proofread text for extra course credit, then “let go” some of the workers (who were actually accomplices of the experimenters). Some subjects were told that those let go had performed poorly (Treatment 1). Others were told that not all could be kept and that it was just luck that they were kept and others let go (Treatment 2). We can’t be sure that the reactions of the students are the same as those of workers who survive a layoff in which other workers lose their jobs. Many behavioral science experiments use student subjects in a campus setting. Do the conclusions apply to the real world?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-237"><p>Lack of realism can limit our ability to apply the conclusions of an experiment to the settings of greatest interest. Most experimenters want to generalize their conclusions to some setting wider than that of the actual experiment. <em>Statistical analysis of an experiment cannot tell us how far the results will generalize to other settings.</em> Nonetheless, the randomized comparative experiment, because of its ability to give convincing evidence for causation, is one of the most important ideas in statistics.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch03-p-239"><p>Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experiments. They illustrate clearly the principles of control, randomization, and repetition. However, completely randomized designs are often inferior to more elaborate statistical designs. In particular, matching the subjects in various ways can produce more precise results than simple randomization.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-240"><p>The simplest use of matching is a <span data-type="termref" data-term="matched pairs design"><strong>matched pairs design</strong></span><span data-block_type="MN-GL-term">matched pairs design</span>, which compares just two treatments. The subjects are matched in pairs. For example, an experiment to compare two advertisements for the same product might use pairs of subjects with the same age, sex, and income. The idea is that matched subjects are more similar than unmatched subjects so that comparing responses within a number of pairs is more efficient than comparing the responses of groups of randomly assigned subjects. Randomization remains important: which one of a matched pair sees the first ad is decided at random. One common variation of the matched pairs design imposes both treatments on the same subjects so that each subject serves as his or her own control. Here is an example.</p></div>

In <span data-type="link" data-href="example_3_11.html">Example 3.11</span>, 40 student subjects were assigned at random, 20 students to each phone. This is a completely randomized design, outlined in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_3_3.html">Figure 3.3</span>. Subjects differ in how satisfied they are with smartphones in general. The completely randomized design relies on chance to create two similar groups of subjects.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-243"><p>If we wanted to do a matched pairs version of this experiment, we would have each college student use each phone for two weeks. An effective design would randomize the <em>order</em> in which the phones are evaluated by each student. This will eliminate bias due to the possibility that the first phone evaluated will be systematically evaluated higher or lower than the second phone evaluated.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-244"><p>The completely randomized design uses chance to decide which subjects will evaluate each smartphone prototype.

Blocking also allows more precise overall conclusions because the systematic differences between men and women can be removed when we study the overall effects of the three therapies. The idea of blocking is an important additional principle of statistical design of experiments. A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important unavoidable sources of variability among the experimental units. Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining variation and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments.</p></div>
