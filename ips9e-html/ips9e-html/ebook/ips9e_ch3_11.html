<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch03-p-528"><p>The production and use of data, like all human endeavors, raise ethical questions. We won’t discuss the telemarketer who begins a telephone sales pitch with “I’m conducting a survey.” Such deception is clearly unethical. It enrages legitimate survey organizations, which find the public less willing to talk with them. Neither will we discuss those few researchers who, in the pursuit of professional advancement, publish fake data. There is no ethical question here—faking data to advance your career is just wrong. It will end your career when uncovered.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-533"><p>The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people. The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by any study that gathers data from human subjects, whether sample survey or experiment.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-538"><p>The law requires that studies funded by the federal government obey these principles. But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is completely clear about the details of their application.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch03-p-540"><p>The purpose of an institutional review board is not to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether it is statistically sound. The board’s purpose is, in the words of one university’s board, “to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) recruited to participate in research activities.” When protocols are greater than minimal risk, a statistician is often included on the board to help determine benefits.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-541"><p>The board reviews the plan of the study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to be sure that subjects are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-542"><p>The most pressing issue concerning institutional review boards is whether their workload has become so large that their effectiveness in protecting subjects drops. There are shorter review procedures for projects that involve only minimal risks to subjects, such as most sample surveys. When a board is overloaded, there is a temptation to put more proposals in the minimal-risk category to speed the work.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch03-p-553"><p>Both words in the phrase “informed consent” are important, and both can be controversial. Subjects must be <em>informed</em> in advance about the nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample survey, physical harm is not possible. The subjects should be told what kinds of questions the survey will ask and about how much of their time it will take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects must then <em>consent</em> in writing.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-first" id="ips9e-ch03-p-555"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-T-ri">Who can give informed consent?</span> Are there some subjects who can’t give informed consent? It was once common, for example, to test new vaccines on prison inmates who gave their consent in return for good-behavior credit. Now we worry that prisoners are not really free to refuse, and the law forbids medical experiments in prisons.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-556"><p>Young children can’t give fully informed consent, so the usual procedure is to ask their parents. A study of new ways to teach reading is about to start at a local elementary school, so the study team sends consent forms home to parents. Many parents don’t return the forms. Can their children take part in the study because the parents did not say No, or should we allow only children whose parents returned the form and said Yes?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-557"><p>What about research into new medical treatments for people with mental disorders? What about studies of new ways to help emergency room patients who may be unconscious or have suffered a stroke? In most cases, there is not time even to get the consent of the family. Does the principle of informed consent bar realistic trials of new treatments for unconscious patients?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-558"><p>These are questions without clear answers. Reasonable people differ strongly on all of them. There is nothing simple about informed consent.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch3_fn25"><sup>25</sup></span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-559"><p>The difficulties of informed consent do not vanish even for capable subjects. Some researchers, especially in medical trials, regard consent as a barrier to getting patients to participate in research. They may not explain all possible risks; they may not point out that there are other therapies that might be better than those being studied; they may be too optimistic in talking with patients even when the consent form has all the right details.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-560"><p>On the other hand, mentioning every possible risk leads to very long consent forms that really are barriers. “They are like rental car contracts,” one lawyer said. Some subjects don’t read forms that run five or six printed pages. Others are frightened by the large number of possible (but unlikely) disasters that might happen and so refuse to participate. Of course, unlikely disasters sometimes happen. When they do, lawsuits follow and the consent forms become yet longer and more detailed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="level_2_title" id="ips9e-ch03-p-561"><p><span data-block_type="h2">Confidentiality</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch03-p-562"><p>Ethical problems do not disappear once a study has been cleared by the review board, has obtained consent from its subjects, and has actually collected data about the subjects. <span data-type="termref" data-term="Confidentiality"><strong>Confidentiality</strong></span><span data-block_type="MN-GL-term">confidentiality</span> means that only the researchers can identify responses of individual subjects. The report of an opinion poll may say what percent of the 1500 respondents felt that legal immigration should be reduced. It may not report what <em>you</em> said about this or any other issue.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-563"><p>Confidentiality is not the same as <span data-type="termref" data-term="anonymity"><strong>anonymity</strong></span><span data-block_type="MN-GL-term">anonymity</span>. Anonymity means that subjects are anonymous—their names are not known even to the director of the study. Anonymity is rare in statistical studies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform subjects of results.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-564"><p>Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best practice is to separate the identity of the subjects from the rest of the data at once. Sample surveys, for example, use the identification only to check on who did or did not respond. In an era of advanced technology, however, it is no longer enough to be sure that each individual set of data protects people’s privacy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-565"><p>The government, for example, maintains a vast amount of information about citizens in many separate databases—census responses, tax returns, Social Security information, data from surveys such as the Current Population Survey, and so on. Many of these databases can be searched by computers for statistical studies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-566"><p>A clever computer search of several databases might be able, by combining information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and other identification have been removed from the data available for search. A colleague from Germany once remarked that “female full professor of statistics with a PhD from the United States” was enough to identify her among all the citizens of Germany. Privacy and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age.</p></div>

Think of tax returns and Social Security contributions. The government needs these data for administrative purposes—to see if we paid the right amount of tax and how large a Social Security benefit we are owed when we retire. Some people feel that individuals should be able to forbid any other use of their data, even with all identification removed. This would prevent using government records to study, say, the ages, incomes, and household sizes of Social Security recipients. Such a study could well be vital to debates on reforming Social Security.</p></div>

Of course, if there is already strong evidence that a treatment works and is safe, it is unethical <em>not</em> to give it.</p></div>

This evidence, however, is not sufficiently strong, to conclude that we would be harming the subjects who would receive the placebo.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-587"><p>Why is it ethical to give a control group of patients a placebo? Well, we know that placebos often work. What is more, placebos have no harmful side effects. In fact, the placebo group may be getting a better treatment than the drug group. If we <em>knew</em> which treatment was better, we would give it to everyone. When we don’t know, it is ethical to try both and compare them.</p></div>

Yet AIDS is more common in parts of Africa than anywhere else. Several clinical trials are looking at ways to prevent pregnant mothers infected with HIV from passing the infection to their unborn children, a major source of HIV infections in Africa. Some people say these trials are unethical because they do not give effective AIDS drugs to their subjects, as would be required in rich nations. Others reply that the trials are looking for treatments that can work in the real world in Africa and that they promise benefits at least to the children of their subjects.

The subjects in <span data-type="link" data-href="example_3_37.html">Example 3.37</span> did not even know they were participating in an experiment. Many behavioral experiments rely on hiding the true purpose of the study. The subjects would change their behavior if told in advance what the investigators were looking for. Subjects are asked to consent on the basis of vague information. They receive full information only after the experiment.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-608"><p>The “Ethical Principles” of the American Psychological Association require consent unless a study merely observes behavior in a public place. They allow deception only when it is necessary to the study, does not hide information that might influence a subject’s willingness to participate, and is explained to subjects as soon as possible. The personal space study (from the 1970s) does not meet current ethical standards.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-609"><p>We see that the basic requirement for informed consent is understood differently in medicine and psychology. Here is an example of another setting with yet another interpretation of what is ethical. The subjects get no information and give no consent. They don’t even know that an experiment may be sending them to jail for the night.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-first" id="ips9e-ch03-p-611"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-T-ri">Domestic violence.</span> How should police respond to domestic violence calls? In the past, the usual practice was to remove the offender and order him to stay out of the household overnight. Police were reluctant to make arrests because the victims rarely pressed charges. Women’s groups argued that arresting offenders would help prevent future violence even if no charges were filed. Is there evidence that arrest will reduce future offenses? That’s a question that experiments have tried to answer.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-612"><p>A typical domestic violence experiment compares two treatments: arrest the suspect and hold him overnight, or warn the suspect and release him. When police officers reach the scene of a domestic violence call, they calm the participants and investigate. Weapons or death threats require an arrest. If the facts permit an arrest but do not require it, an officer radios headquarters for instructions. The person on duty opens the next envelope in a file prepared in advance by a statistician. The envelopes contain the treatments in random order. The police either arrest the suspect or warn and release him, depending on the contents of the envelope. The researchers then watch police records and visit the victim to see if the domestic violence reoccurs.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="ips9e-ch03-p-613"><p>The first such experiment appeared to show that arresting domestic violence suspects does reduce their future violent behavior. As a result of this evidence, arrest has become the common police response to domestic violence.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch03-p-614"><p>The domestic violence experiments shed light on an important issue of public policy. Because there is no informed consent, the ethical rules that govern clinical trials and most social science studies would forbid these experiments. They were cleared by review boards because, in the words of one domestic violence researcher, “These people became subjects by committing acts that allow the police to arrest them. You don’t need consent to arrest someone.”</p></div>
