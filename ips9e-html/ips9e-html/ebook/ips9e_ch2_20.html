<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch02-p-978"><p>In many studies of the relationship between two variables, the goal is to establish that changes in the explanatory variable <em>cause</em> changes in the response variable. Even when a strong association is present, however, the conclusion that this association is due to a causal link between the variables is often hard to justify. What ties between two variables (and others lurking in the background) can explain an observed association? What constitutes good evidence for causation? We begin our consideration of these questions with a set of observed associations. In each case, there is a clear association between variable <em>x</em> and variable <em>y</em>. Moreover, the association is positive whenever the direction makes sense.</p></div>

Can we use <em>r</em> or <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> to say how much inheritance contributes to the daughters’ BMIs? No. It may well be that mothers who are overweight also set an example of little exercise, poor eating habits, and lots of television. Their daughters pick up these habits to some extent, so the influence of heredity is mixed up with influences from the girls’ environment. We call this mixing of influences <em>confounding.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1003"><p> <em>When many uncontrolled variables are related to a response variable, you should always ask whether or not confounding of several variables prevents you from drawing conclusions about causation.</em> The third diagram in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_2_31.html">Figure 2.31</span> illustrates confounding. Both the explanatory variable <em>x</em> and the lurking variable <em>z</em> may influence the response variable <em>y</em>. Because <em>x</em> is confounded with <em>z</em>, we cannot distinguish the influence of <em>x</em> from the influence of <em>z</em>. We cannot say how strong the direct effect of <em>x</em> on <em>y</em> is. In fact, it can be hard to say if <em>x</em> influences <em>y</em> at all.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1005"><p>Many observed associations are at least partly explained by lurking variables. Both common response and confounding involve the influence of a lurking variable (or variables) <em>z</em> on the response variable <em>y</em>. The distinction between these two types of relationship is less important than the common element, the influence of lurking variables. The most important lesson of these examples is one we have already emphasized: <strong>even a very strong association between two variables is not by itself good evidence that there is a cause-and-effect link between the variables</strong>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1007"><p>How can a direct causal link between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> be established? The best method—indeed, the only fully compelling method—of establishing causation is to conduct a carefully designed experiment in which the effects of possible lurking variables are controlled. <span data-type="link" data-href="ips9e-ch03.xml">Chapter 3</span> explains how to design convincing experiments.</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="right" data-block_type="page_start" id="ips9e_page_151"><p>151</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1008"><p>Many of the sharpest disputes in which statistics plays a role involve questions of causation that cannot be settled by experiment. Does gun control reduce violent crime? Does living near power lines cause cancer? Has “outsourcing” work to overseas locations reduced overall employment in the United States? All these questions have become public issues. All concern associations among variables. And all have this in common: they try to pinpoint cause and effect in a setting involving complex relations among many interacting variables. Common response and confounding, along with the number of potential lurking variables, make observed associations misleading. Experiments are not possible for ethical or practical reasons. We can’t assign some people to live near power lines or compare the same nation with and without strong gun controls.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1011"><p>It isn’t ethical to do experiments that expose children to magnetic fields. It’s hard to compare cancer rates among children who happen to live in more and less exposed locations because leukemia is rare and locations vary in many ways other than magnetic fields. We must rely on studies that compare children who have leukemia with children who don’t.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-TXT-ni" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1012"><p>A careful study of the effect of magnetic fields on children took five years and cost $5 million. The researchers compared 638 children who had leukemia and 620 who did not. They went into the homes and actually measured the magnetic fields in the children’s bedrooms, in other rooms, and at the front door. They recorded facts about nearby power lines for the family home and also for the mother’s residence when she was pregnant. Result: no evidence of more than a chance connection between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch2_fn29"><sup>29</sup></span></p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1013"><p>“No evidence” that magnetic fields are connected with childhood leukemia doesn’t prove that there is no risk. It says only that a careful study could not find any risk that stands out from the play of chance that distributes leukemia cases across the landscape. Critics continue to argue that the study failed to measure some lurking variables or that the children studied don’t fairly represent all children. Nonetheless, a carefully designed study comparing children with and without leukemia is a great advance over haphazard and sometimes emotional counting of cancer cases.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-last" id="ips9e-ch02-p-1016"><p>Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. Comparison of smokers and similar nonsmokers showed a very strong association between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association be due to common response? Might there be, for example, a genetic factor that predisposes people both to nicotine addiction and to lung cancer? Smoking and lung cancer would then be positively associated even if smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. Or perhaps confounding is to blame. It might be that smokers live unhealthy lives in other ways (diet, alcohol, lack of exercise) and that some other habit confounded with smoking is a cause of lung cancer. How were these objections overcome?</p></div>
