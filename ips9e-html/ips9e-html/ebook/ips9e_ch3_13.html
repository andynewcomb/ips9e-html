Only summary information was published. The policy of the journal requires that all data used in the articles it publishes be available to the public, and it archives the data on a website. When you examine the data, you realize that you have a unique set of characteristics that would allow someone who knows you very well to identify which data are from you. Someone who does not know you would not be able to do this. Are the data confidential? Explain your answer.</p></div>

The subjects were patients who had advanced disease and had received standard treatments with no success. Of the 94 subjects who received the vaccine, 26 died during the study. Their deaths were not due to the vaccine. Some family members of the subjects sued the hospital, the study director, the company that made the vaccine, a university official, individual members of the IRB, and the university bioethicist who consulted with the IRB.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_ch3_fn31"><sup>31</sup></span> Discuss this case from the point of view of ethics.

<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch03-p-627"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.82 The Vytorin controversy.</span> Vytorin is a combination pill designed to lower cholesterol. It consists of a relatively inexpensive and widely used drug, Zocor, and a newer drug called Zetia. Early study results suggested that Vytorin was no more effective than Zetia. Critics claimed that the makers of the drugs tried to change the response variable for the study, and two congressional panels investigated why there was a two-year delay in the release of the results. Use the Internet to search for more information about this controversy and write a report about what you find. Include an evaluation in the framework of ethical use of experiments and data. A good place to start your search would be to look for the phrase “Vytorin’s shortcomings.”</p></div>

<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch03-p-629"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.84 Anonymity and confidentiality in health screening.</span> Texas A&amp;M, like many universities, offers free screening for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The announcement says, “Persons who sign up for the HIV Screening will be assigned a number so that they do not have to give their name.” They can learn the results of the test by telephone, still without giving their name.

<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch03-p-630"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.85 Anonymity and confidentiality in mail surveys.</span> Some common practices may appear to offer anonymity while actually delivering only confidentiality. Market researchers often use mail surveys that do not ask the respondent’s identity but contain hidden codes on the questionnaire that identify the respondent. A false claim of anonymity is clearly unethical. If only confidentiality is promised, is it also unethical to say nothing about the identifying code, perhaps causing respondents to believe their replies are anonymous?</p></div>

<h3>Question

<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch03-p-631"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.86 Use of stored blood.</span> Long ago, doctors drew a blood specimen from you as part of treating minor anemia. Unknown to you, the sample was stored. Now researchers plan to use stored samples from you and many other people to look for genetic factors that may influence anemia. It is no longer possible to ask your consent. Modern technology can read your entire genetic makeup from the blood sample.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch03-p-632"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(a)</span> Do you think it violates the principle of informed consent to use your blood sample if your name is on it but you were not told that it might be saved and studied later?</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch03-p-633"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(b)</span> Suppose that your identity is not attached. The blood sample is known only to come from (say) “a 20-year-old white female being treated for anemia.” Is it now OK to use the sample for research?</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch03-p-634"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(c)</span> Perhaps we should use biological materials such as blood samples only from patients who have agreed to allow the material to be stored for later use in research. It isn’t possible to say in advance what kind of research, so this falls short of the usual standard for informed consent. Is it nonetheless acceptable, given complete confidentiality and the fact that using the sample can’t physically harm the patient?</p></div></li>

<li><div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch03-p-638"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(c)</span> The polling organization usually has a professional name such as “Samples Incorporated,” so respondents don’t know that the poll is being paid for by a political party or candidate.

<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch03-p-639"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.88 Should poll results be made public?</span> Some people think that the law should require that all political results be made public. Otherwise, the possessors of poll results can use the information to their own advantage. They can act on the information, release only selected parts of it, or time the release for best effect. A candidate’s organization replies that it is paying for the poll to gain information for its own use, not to amuse the public. Do you favor requiring complete disclosure of political poll results? What about other private surveys, such as market research surveys of consumer tastes?</p></div>

<h3>Question
			    <span data-type="number">3.89 </span><span data-type="title"></span>

<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL" id="ips9e-ch03-p-640"><p><span data-block_type="SR-XH">3.89 Informed consent to take blood samples.</span> Researchers from Yale, working with medical teams in Tanzania, wanted to know how common infection with the AIDS virus is among pregnant women in that country. To do this, they planned to test blood samples drawn from pregnant women.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="SR-X-QUE-NL-lvl2" id="ips9e-ch03-p-641"><p>Yale’s institutional review board insisted that the researchers get the informed consent of each woman and tell her the results of the test. This is the usual procedure in developed nations. The Tanzanian government did not want to tell the women why blood was drawn or tell them the test results. The government feared panic if many people turned out to have an incurable disease for which the country’s medical system could not provide care. The study was canceled. Do you think that Yale was right to apply its usual standards for protecting subjects?</p></div>
